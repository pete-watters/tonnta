# Tonnta

**Tonnta** (Irish: _waves_) — a surf-conditions companion for Donabate, Co. Dublin.

One question, answered in five seconds: **is it worth going down, and what board do I
bring?**

- **Verdict, not a data table** — GO / MAYBE / FLAT / BLOWN OUT, driven by live wave
  and wind conditions for Donabate beach
- **Board call** — SUP, foamie or longboard, with the reasoning
- **Alerts** — get pinged when it's on (waves ≥ 0.4 m and the wind behaves)
- **Live sea state** — nearby buoy observations, tides and sea temperature
